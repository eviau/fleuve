# fleuve - a personalized programming language

*But it is the software that gives the orders, acting on the outside world and on machines that exist only as functions of software and evolve so that they can work out ever more complex programs.*

* Italo Calvino, Six Memos for the Next Millennium (1988) , "Lightness" English translation: Patrick Creagh (1996).


The language *fleuve* (river in French) might be a programming language, but *fleuve* has not yet decided if it wanted to be one. It is a language that is a bit like a personal diary, a bit like a secret language, and maybe none of this.

*fleuve* might be interpretable (sometimes) but only rarely compiles to anything.

*fleuve* is elsewhere.

*fleuve* does not take itself seriously, except on Saturday at 6h30am precisely, if trees are blossoming. then, and only then, does *fleuve* dresses up nicely to go take a walk outside - and starts over its own rules, its own game.

when *fleuve* takes itself seriously, it says that we must free programming from the materiality of computers. yes, it is what it says.

## the rules

rules are written as they happen.

sometimes, they are rewritten, in parts or completely.

*fleuve* is retro-compatible: a new word introduced in the grammar will always be paired with something, and will always have the same signature - but its behaviour might be erratic.

## let's dive in.

let's start writing *fleuve*. for now, it will be in Python.

## fleuve's index

the rules, written in Python, of fleuve, can be found in `fleuve_interprete.py`.

the rules, written in French, of fleuve, can be found in `fleuve_rules.md`.

the essay that comes with fleuve is in `essai_accompagnateur.md`: this is a more thorough explanation of the project, with references and resources. it's a bit messy but you will find your way.
