# essay: what is a programming language?

*where I am vaguely thinking*

bear with me, this is a draft.

## a language that knows how to communicate instructions to a computer

first definition: a language that may communicate instructions to a computer

so then, what is the difference between a program that is a programming language and a program that is simply, a program? is it because you can create variables? functions?

*15nov2020 translation comment*: is it because you can implement a Turing machine?

## but then, what is a computer?

on top of this, what is a computer? what kind of computer is possible outside Turing's definitions? Is there any computer who exists outsides of theses definitions? What other computers are possible?

*another computer is possible*

## what is a language?

defining a language by its use: a language use is to communicate. if I am the only one to use a language, can we say that there is communication, that I am communicating? does communication necessarily implies part and counterpart?

does communication implies that there is a rematch - this is what I am asking...

## playing on the definition of a language

what interests me here with *fleuve* is not a programming language as a tool, its limitations, etc. - it is the programming language as a work of art valid in itself. I posit that we can write poetry in natural languages - something that is generally accepted - and I also posit that we can create languages that are, in themselves, poetry.

and I am submitting *fleuve* to this review: *fleuve* is a work-in-itself, with its rules, grammar and reserved words. *fleuve* *happens to be* (in English in the text) also a programming language - as a happenstance.

## the limits of my language are the limits of my universe (wittgenstein)

we often believe that a language must be able to describe everything. in reality, a language has its own limits, if only the limits of our imagination... hence, I am saying that we should not judge communications languages with no apparent usecase on the Turing criteria, that is, the criteria of being complete in the Turing meaning - anyway, we have yet to define what a computer is so there you go.

## language as a work of art for itself, in itself

this is what I am most interested in: language as a work of art *à part entière* (for itself, in itself).

the question is not to use language, to play with it by creating novels, poems, and drama plays: the question is to create a language whose rules, in and for themselves, are a work of art.

it is not language that is the medium anymore, but all of its linguistics, grammar, etc.

## language as an artistic medium

is klingon a work of art? we could make a difference between languages who happens to be work of art and languages who are made to be work of art. the boundary is not obvious.

## defining virtual, artificials languages

is esperanto a work of art? if you ask me - I cannot read not speak esperanto - yes, yes it is one.

## esolangs

the core idea that interestes me includes esolangs and expand them: I am not only interested in eccentric programming languages who pushes the limit of programming. I am also interested in programing languages who pushes the limits of languages strucutres, naturals or artificials or programming or others. I am interested in programming languages as linguistics tools.

I believe I am not alone... I am always looking for relevant references and thinking paths on this topic. Please get in touch if you wish to share your own, either by opening a GitHub Issue or a PR or writing me an email: fleuve.programmation@gmail.com

## code as a work of art, for itself, by itself

"but you don't understand, code is only used to do things, it's not interesting in itself!"

I have my doubts, and I am not alone.

## char stiles, livecoding manifesto

see the [char stiles manifesto for livecoding](http://charstiles.com/keystrokes/).

in livecoding (often as an arts medium but not only), we generally consider that it is essential that the programming parts are made available to anyone who is currently watching.

the code in itself is a work of art, the code is interesting, [I am not alone in thinking this](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2015-01.html#e2015-01-16T14_59_08.htm)

## language as a poem in itself

we could apply this to natural languages! language in itself as a poem. its rules being studied as a works of art, their structures see in the daylight, its scaffolding as they are - and not only what we do with it.

the tool not as a medium, but as a work of art. (a tiny bit like magritte, but for laguage).

## interpreting a program as we interpret a drama play

it's a strange word, interpreter, for a programming language. let's push the analogy further: let's interpret programs as we would interpret drama plays - let's do thte *mise en scène* of a program! I want programs focused on something else than being useful, I want non-deterministic programs, I want programs that are, in themselves, works of art... and I want to do the *mise en scène* of these programs.

## *mise en scène* for programming

*pass* for now

[maybe this?](http://anaximandrake.blogspirit.com/archive/2012/11/19/nervus-probandi.html)


## natural langage as a programming language for humans: seeing the world with the eyes of a computer

how do computers see the world? do they understand natural languages, human languages, as programming languages for computers?

## why pick one logic when you can have all of them?

to be able to build useful, working computers, we had to pick one logic.

to be able to build an innocative, creative computers, maybe we need to pick... all of the logics?

what keeps us from creating program and programming languages (who are the same, in the end) that will be different, divorced from our world - in a fundamental way? why should we restrict ourselves to what make sense to humans? why program a computer as if it was a very meticulous person?

let's go further. let's explore. let's dive in.

this is my novel... *fleuve*.
