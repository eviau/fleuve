*rough translation of the `fleuve_rules.md` doc*

# fleuve - a few rules

## rules that were implemented

### types

types here are made of only useful things, like flowers (rose, tulips and sunflower), fruits (apple, melon and tomato), a variety of waterbodies (lake, pond and creek) and a few integers (only those who are even). other things does not interests us, for now... come back later.


## rules that might be implemented

### excluded middle

in *fleuve*, it is possible that things are undecidable.

### synonyms

in *fleuve*, there is a function who looks up, in the corpus of already declared functions, the functions who have the same signature as the one that was called; it then picks one function among them, and switch the one who was called by the one that was picked, without asking anything to the user.
